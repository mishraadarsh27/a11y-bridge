# Frontend

React + TypeScript (Vite) app.

Commands (from `frontend/`):

```powershell path=null start=null
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173. Use the UI to connect to `ws://localhost:8000/ws` and send a message; you should see `echo:<message>` in the list.

Planned next:
- Camera/mic capture via Web APIs
- Three.js avatar for sign synthesis
- i18n with i18next
